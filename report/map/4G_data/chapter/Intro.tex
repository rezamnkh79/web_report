%\section{Introduction}
%\textit{Drive testing} is a method of measuring and assessing the coverage, capacity and Quality of Service (QoS) of a mobile radio network. The technique consists of using a motor vehicle containing mobile radio network air interface measurement equipment that can detect and record a wide variety of the physical and virtual parameters of mobile cellular service in a given geographical area. By measuring what a wireless network subscriber would experience in any specific area, wireless carriers can make directed changes to their networks that provide better coverage and service to their customers.
