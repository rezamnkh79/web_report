\begin{enumerate}
	\item Alone TAC was detected \textcolor{Red}{\scalebox{1.8}{$\frownie$}} (\autoref{fig:aloneTAC}).
	\item Huge improvements in RSRQ, compared to Test 2022/02/11 \textcolor{Green}{\scalebox{1.8}{$\smiley$}}.
		\item Huge decrease in Data Test results (e.g. Ping, Jitter, Throughput, DNS), compared to Test 2022/02/11 \textcolor{Red}{\scalebox{1.8}{$\frownie$}}.
	\item Mean delay test $313$ms and std $467.11$. For Test 2022/02/11 these values are $108.06$ ms and $224.15$ \textcolor{Red}{\scalebox{1.8}{$\frownie$}}.
	\item Decrease $1.5$ MB in througput compared to Test 2022/02/11 \textcolor{Red}{\scalebox{1.8}{$\frownie$}}.
	\item Some major regions were detected with bad serving cell RSRP (\autoref{fig:badrsrp}).
	\item Some regions were detected with bad serving cell RSRQ (\autoref{fig:badrsrq}).
	\item Neigbor cells RSRQ were \textit{Very Bad}.
	\item $84.49\%$ serving cells are in Band 1 and ARFCN $3300$.
	\item $0.63\%$ serving cell RSRP below $-105$dBm.
		\item $4.85\%$ serving cell RSRP below $-16$dB.
